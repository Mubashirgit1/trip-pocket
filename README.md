During the development and deployment of **Pocket Trip**, several technical issues were identified and resolved to ensure a smooth, responsive, and stable user experience.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Input Validation on Search Page
**Issue:**  
Users could search with incomplete fields, past dates, or return dates earlier than departure.  

**Fix:**  
- Added strict **frontend and backend validation** in Django and JavaScript.  
- Prevents searches with missing fields or invalid date ranges.  
- Displays clear alert messages to guide users.

**Result:**  
Ensures data accuracy and prevents incorrect or empty flight queries.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Currency Conversion (IDR ‚Üí GBP)
**Issue:**  
Flight prices returned by the API were in **Indonesian Rupiah (IDR)**, confusing users expecting British Pounds.  

**Fix:**  
Implemented **automatic backend currency conversion** to display prices in **GBP (¬£)** using exchange rate data.  

**Result:**  
All flight listings now show prices consistently in Pounds Sterling.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Allauth Signup Page Styling with Crispy Forms
**Issue:**  
Default Django-Allauth signup/login pages were not responsive or styled.  

**Fix:**  
- Integrated **`django-crispy-forms`**, **`crispy-bootstrap5`**, and **`django-widget-tweaks`**.  
- Applied consistent Bootstrap styling for all forms.  
- Adjusted layout for responsiveness on mobile and desktop.  

**Result:**  
A visually appealing and mobile-friendly authentication flow.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. CRUD Operations with JavaScript
**Issue:**  
CRUD actions (edit, delete, re-run saved searches) required page reloads, slowing down UX.  

**Fix:**  
Added **asynchronous JavaScript functions** using `fetch()` for instant updates:  
- Delete and edit searches dynamically.  
- Show confirmation toasts.  
- Re-run previous search filters seamlessly.  

**Result:**  
Improved interactivity and smoother user workflow without reloading the page.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. RapidAPI Key Limit and No Response Issue
**Issue:**  
After two days, flight data stopped loading due to **RapidAPI request limits**.  

**Fix:**  
- Diagnosed the issue using Heroku logs (`heroku logs --tail`).  
- Added error handling for API timeouts and non-200 responses.  
- Generated a new **RapidAPI key** and updated it using Heroku config vars.  
- Implemented retry logic and basic caching to prevent hitting limits again.  

**Result:**  
Reliable API performance with automatic recovery from failures or quota resets.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Heroku Allauth Configuration and Database Connectivity
**Issue:**  
Deployment on Heroku caused login redirects to fail and database connections to drop intermittently.  

**Fix:**  
- Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the Heroku domain.  
- Configured all `django-allauth` environment variables via `heroku config:set`.  
- Integrated `dj-database-url` with `ssl_require=True` for secure PostgreSQL connections.  
- Ran migrations and collected static files through Heroku CLI.  

**Result:**  
Stable authentication, database operations, and full pipeline deployment.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. Heroku Pipeline Setup and CI/CD
**Issue:**  
Manual deployment steps risked inconsistencies between staging and production environments.  

**Fix:**  
- Created a **Heroku pipeline** for staging and production.  
- Connected to GitHub for **automatic deploys**.  
- Added release phase in `Procfile` for automatic migrations.  

**Result:**  
Smooth, continuous deployment process with version tracking and rollback support.

---

### ‚úÖ 8. API Synchronization and Loading Indicators
**Issue:**  
Flight results and airport lists didn‚Äôt always load together, showing incomplete data.  

**Fix:**  
- Added loading spinners while fetching data.  
- Ensured asynchronous API calls complete before rendering results.  
- Added error handling for partial responses.  

**Result:**  
Consistent, complete, and user-friendly search experience.

---

### ‚úÖ 9. Database and Pipeline Configuration
**Issue:**  
Initial PostgreSQL setup on Heroku failed due to missing SSL settings.  

**Fix:**  
- Added `dj-database-url` with `conn_max_age` and `ssl_require=True`.  
- Re-ran migrations and confirmed connection with `heroku run python manage.py migrate`.  
- Verified pipeline linking and environment consistency between staging and production.  

**Result:**  
Fully functional PostgreSQL integration and secure database connections.

---

### ‚úÖ 10. Validation and Error Handling Enhancements
**Fix Summary:**  
- All search form fields are required.  
- Past dates are restricted.  
- Alerts added for invalid return/departure combinations.  
- Added ‚ÄúSearching flights...‚Äù loading states for better UX.  

**Result:**  
Professional, reliable user interactions with clear feedback on errors and loading progress.

---

## üêû Known Bugs

While **Pocket Trip** is fully functional, there are a few limitations and pending issues to be aware of:

---

### 1. API Rate Limits
- **Issue:** RapidAPI calls may fail when the daily quota is exceeded.  
- **Impact:** Flight search may not return results until the quota resets or a new API key is applied.  
- **Workaround:** Limit repeated searches for the same routes and monitor API usage.  

---

### 2. Hotel, Taxi, and Tour Integration (Future)
- **Issue:** These modules are planned but not yet fully integrated.  
- **Impact:** Users cannot book hotels, taxis, or tours directly through the app yet.  
- **Workaround:** Users can save searches and plan manually until the feature is implemented.  

---

### 3. Real-Time Images and Weather
- **Issue:** The real-time location images and weather APIs are under development.  
- **Impact:** Destinations currently show only static placeholders without live updates.  
- **Workaround:** Users can still view flights and saved searches normally.  

---

### 4. Slow API Responses for Certain Routes
- **Issue:** Some flight searches may take longer due to provider response times.  
- **Impact:** Delays in loading search results may occur occasionally.  
- **Workaround:** Loading indicators are present; users should wait a few seconds for results to appear.  

---

### 5. Limited Offline Functionality
- **Issue:** Pocket Trip relies on API calls and requires an active internet connection.  
- **Impact:** No offline search or saved flight updates are available.  
- **Workaround:** Users can view previously saved searches, but new searches require connectivity.  

---

### 6. Social Login Redirect Edge Cases
- **Issue:** Rarely, social login (Google/Facebook) redirects may fail due to provider misconfiguration or outdated tokens.  
- **Impact:** User may need to retry login or use email/password authentication.  
- **Workaround:** Check social provider keys and redirect URIs if persistent.  

---

**Note:** All bugs listed are either minor or planned for future releases. The core functionality of flight search, saved searches, and CRUD operations is stable and fully operational.
